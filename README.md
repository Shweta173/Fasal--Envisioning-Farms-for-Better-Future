### :sparkles:About Fasal
Agriculture plays a vital role in India’s economy and provides employment to a large portion of the population. One of the major challenges faced by farmers is the lack of proper guidance in selecting suitable crops for their regions, along with limited access to accurate market and profit-related information. This often results in low productivity and reduced profit margins.

The objective of this study is to develop a machine learning–based approach for predicting agricultural yield and crop prices. By analyzing factors such as soil type and climatic conditions, the system aims to assist farmers in making informed decisions regarding crop selection.

Additionally, farmers currently lack a centralized platform that provides access to essential information such as suitable crops, soil characteristics, market prices, government schemes, and the latest agricultural updates. To address this issue, a machine learning–based agricultural portal is proposed, offering a single point of access to all relevant information and support for farmers.
 
### :sparkles:About the Project 
Several recent studies conducted in India, including the Doubling Farmers’ Income (DFI) initiative, have highlighted the key challenges affecting the agricultural sector. These studies emphasize the need for timely availability of agricultural inputs, greater focus on improving productivity—particularly for small and marginal farmers—and the adoption of modern farming techniques. They also recommend the optimal use of resources and informed crop selection through both macro- and micro-level planning.

Fasal is derived from the Hindi words “Fasal” (crops) and “Kisaan” (farmers), reflecting its role as a digital companion for farmers. As the name suggests, the platform is designed to support farmers in making informed agricultural decisions. Farmers play a crucial role in fulfilling basic food requirements and shaping the agricultural ecosystem. Through effective management of farming practices, they contribute to the long-term sustainability of soil, crops, and the overall balance of flora and fauna.

Agriculture currently occupies nearly one-third of the Earth’s land surface and remains one of the most essential human activities, as it provides food for a large majority of the global population. Ensuring sustainable and efficient agricultural practices is therefore critical for food security and environmental balance.

Key Features of the Fasal Platform

Gain Insights
Fasal serves as a centralized source of information, enabling farmers to gain deep insights into their farmland. The platform helps farmers plan farm layouts efficiently, optimize resource utilization, and maximize productivity and revenue.

Field Planning
Farmers can define individual land plots and select the crops they intend to cultivate. Using real-time data related to soil quality, weather conditions, and air quality, the system supports informed crop planning decisions.

Real-Time Analysis with Environmental Impact
Fasal evaluates the suitability of a specific plot for a selected crop and provides an estimated yield and economic value based on current environmental conditions.

Environmental Degradation Assessment
The platform computes a Fasal Score to assess the environmental impact of farming practices, including crop choice and irrigation methods. This score helps farmers understand and minimize land degradation.

AI-Based Assistance
Powered by artificial intelligence, Fasal recommends suitable crops, identifies unfavorable crop combinations, and suggests effective crop rotation techniques to maintain soil health and long-term productivity.

Crop Yield Prediction and Estimation
Fasal predicts crop performance across all four seasons, helping farmers estimate production costs, expected returns, and funding requirements in advance.n
